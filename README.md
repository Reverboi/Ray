### Compiling

The way I compile this project is relatively standard and straightforward for a C++ project. If you follow this procedure and have already procured the necessary dependencies listed in the [Installation](#installation) section everything should work as intended.

Firstly, using your preffered terminal-shell-emulator-command-line-interface-whatever-you-wanna-call-it, navigate to the directory where the compilation will take place, i usually make a dirctory named "build" (how original!) inside the root directory of the project (alongside tis README.md). Navigate to that directory, type ```cmake ..``` and them ```make```
Summarizing, starting from the root directory of the project, do this:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
